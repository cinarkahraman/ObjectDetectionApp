## Object Detection App
This project is a mobile application built with Flutter and powered by TensorFlow Lite. The app performs real-time object detection on images or video streams using pretrained models and you can upload the taken image Firebase store there, offering a seamless experience for recognizing objects on Android and iOS platforms.

## Features
  * Real-time object detection: Identifies objects using TensorFlow Lite models.
  * Cross-platform: Compatible with Android and iOS devices.
  * Easy-to-use interface: Simple UI built with Flutter for smooth user interaction.
  * Performance-optimized: Runs efficiently on mobile devices with low latency.
## Technologies Used
  * Flutter: For the frontend mobile interface.
  * TensorFlow Lite: For machine learning inference.
  * Pretrained models: Includes MobileNet SSD models for detecting common objects.

## Usage
* Launch the app on your device.
* Allow camera permissions for real-time detection.
* Point the camera towards objects to see detection results displayed in real-time with bounding boxes.
## Model Integration
The app uses TensorFlow Lite models to detect objects. You can customize the app with different models by:

Placing the .tflite model file and label map (labels.txt) inside the assets folder.
Updating the pubspec.yaml file to include these assets:
yaml
Copy code
assets:
  - assets/model.tflite
  - assets/labels.txt
